### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

I am Alessandro Rodi, Italian, class 1986. 

I live in ZÃ¼rich (ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­) where I currently work at [Renuo AG](https://renuo.ch).

Since 2016 I am also Partner of the company, together with [Samuel Steiner](https://github.com/samuelsteiner) and [Josua Schmid](https://github.com/schmijos).

At Renuo I work as a Software Developer and my main field of expertise is Ruby and Ruby On Rails.

I have a past as Java developer, but these days are gone.

As a Senior Web Developer, I am also very strong with usual languages like Javascript, HTML and CSS.

I actively contribute/maintain Open Source projects like [CanCanCan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan). 

Check the list of my popular repositories down below ðŸ‘‡.

Please consider Sponsoring me if you use these Open Source projects: https://github.com/sponsors/coorasse. It's really fun and stressy at the same time to work on them.

I write articles and tutorials for developers, mainly in the Ruby On Rails community, and I usually speak at the local [ZÃ¼rich Ruby On Rails meetup](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/rubyonrails-ch/).
